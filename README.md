# **SnakeHunter - ESP32 Multi-Tool**  
*(Inspired by Flipper Zero)*  

A versatile **ESP32-based** device with a **TFT touchscreen**, inspired by the **Flipper Zero**, but focused on **IR control, and more**. Built on the **Bruce firmware** framework, this project turns your ESP32 into a pocket-sized hacking. <br>
I made this project because I love cybersecurity specialy networks and the idea of cloneing them.
