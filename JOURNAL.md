I searched about ESP32 and knew a lot about ESP32 mardauder and another software that i can use it called bruce and found a schematic that i can use as a refrence. and made the schematic and slept on the laptop ü•≤üëç. and learned about nRFID and 2.2ghz signals and how they work. and learned about the IR. and i am very exited to copy my TV's remote signal and emitte it with the device again. <br>

Collected all the 3d models to add it into onshape so i can make my case. <br>
and i finished the case and the project is all ready i guess i need only to collect the BOM and calculate it. <br>
 ### the final case:

the on shape doc: [onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/31774ac2186697d46231e598/w/dbd08ada5937ae301b7df84d/e/903237f827f58fb8f220f074) <br>
I made the case in 6 hours and iam very happy that i made it that quick because i have learned onshape when i made my snakepad.
